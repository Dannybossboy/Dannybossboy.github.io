                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The idea for this game was to make a 3D dungeon crawler where the player has to navigate a maze filled with enemies and reach the end to defeat the dragon. The player gains xp from defeating enemies, gathers materials to sell and uses equipment to do and take more damage. This ended up being one of my favorite games Ive worked on and one of my most well recieved games.</p>

                </ul>
                <h4>Art</h4>
                <ul class="contributions">
                    <li>Created all the 3D art, the 2D art was taken from 3rd party sources.</li>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was part of my university's Game Dev Club's first game jam of the semester. I worked with an extremely talented team, we started with a few concepts and it snowballed until we had an interesting concept and mechanics. The idea was that you play as a villian who planted a bomb in a tower and you have to escape before it goes off. You have to use your time rewind mechanic to solve puzzles and make it out before 1 minute passes.</p>

                    <li>Worked off concepts provided by the art team to alter and construct levels.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Programming</h3>
                <ul class="contributions">
                    <li>Time rewind system: Used abstract classes to give objects unique behaviors during time rewind. As well as replaying positions and rotations physics objects made over time.</li>
                    <li>Player Movement: Created a intermediate player controller featuring jump-cuts, coyote time and altered gravity make jumps feel good.</li>
                    <li>2D Physics Objects: Implemented satisfiyng physics based movement of objects such as cogs turning, pistons extending and boxs falling. All which inherit methods that controls behavior during time rewind.</li>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>For this project I worked with 3 talented team members I found on the jam website, 2 artist, 1 coder(me) and 1 sound designer. The idea was to make a cozy arcade style game where bramble spreads across the map and enemies spawn from it. Your goal is to destroy the bramble and upgrade yourself and your base while at it.</p>

                    <li>Created a grid based system where bramble slowly spreads to its neighbors until it envelops the entire screen.</li>
                    <li>Created a modular upgrade system where players can choose and use the upgrade of their choice.</li>
                    <li>Crafted a simple and satisfiyng combat system for players to use against enemies.</li>
                    <li>Developed simple enemy AI that gives unique behavior for each enemy.</li>

                <p>The idea for this game was to make a fun and short 3D platformer, involving a small cute robot whos goals is to clear all 3 levels. Along the way you have to avoid different hazards, obtain keys and unlock doors to finally escape.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The idea for this project was to make it more of an arcade game where players have the simple goal of suriving as long as possible while avoiding enemies and climbing as high as they can. In total we had 6 people, 2 programmers (including me), 2 artists and 2 sound designers.</p>

                <ul class="contributions">
                    <li>Created most of the 2D art, including player, animations and enviornment. The rest was handled by the other artist.</li>

                <ul class="contributions">

                    <li>Worked with the other programmer to create a infinite level generator that stacks modular pieces on top of each other to create a seamless track to move on.</li>
                    <li>Helped create satisfiyng enemies by using 2D pathfinding AI, basic methods for attacks and enemy spawning.</li>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The concept for this game was inspired by Jump King, the idea is that you play as a princess who has to save her crying knight on top of the tower. The twist is that you can only launch yourself and you have to build platforms to reach the top. This ended up being one of the more entertaining games ive created in my opinion.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was part of my university's Game Dev Club's first game jam of the semester. I started off the project with 1 other team member, but due to him being busy I ended up being the sole developer of this game. The idea was to create a short platformer with the basic mechanic of toggling lava and water to overcome small puzzles.</p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <h4>Level Design</h3>
                <ul class="contributions">
                    <li>Created each level with a simple and clear goal, while progressively making each level more difficult.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Programming</h3>
                <ul class="contributions">
                    <li>Created the switch mechanic which turns off and on sections of water which you can swim in and lava which kills you.</li>
                    <li>Player Movement: Created an advanced player controller featuring jump-cuts, coyote time, jump buffering, air gravity/friction and satisfiyng squash and stretch to add juice.</li>
                    <li>Coded the rest of the miscellinious features such as UI navigation, respawning, level switching and cutscenes.</li>
