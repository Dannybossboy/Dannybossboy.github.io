            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio, my name is Daniel Smirnoff. Little bit about me, I'm an extremely passionate and driven game developer, I appreciate game development as an art form and am constantly surprised by the amount of creativity and innovation behind them. For me personally I enjoy creating challenging and thought provoking experiences where players can experience a story, face hardships and eventually overcome their problems.</p>


            <!--
            <h2>My experiences</h2>
            <P>I believe that over the years I've gained a great deal of experience, working on personal projects and game jams has been extremely rewarding and an eye opening experience. I would wear many hats during development, from art direction, narrative, audio design and gameplay programming, these are just a few roles to name and all crucial in delivering the ideal experience for the players.</P>
            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>I am extremely excited to grow as a developer and a programmer, I seek out new opportunities to hopefully grow myself and learn more about this industry. I seriously do believe that games do create a lasting impact on players and I hope to be a part of this industry to innovate on the limit games can be pushed to.</p>

            <h2>My Life</h2>
            <p>My hobbies outside of game development include rock climbing, gaming and going to the gym. Personally I enjoy rock climbing because of its problem solving aspect, I have always enjoyed gaming and believe I have to play games in order to understand how and why they appeal to players.</p>
